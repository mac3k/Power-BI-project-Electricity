POWER BI PROJECT

**Assignment**
This time you will not be answering questions, but it is entirely up to you to choose which indicators are most interesting to you.
You can, of course, take inspiration from the questions from the first project, but most importantly you must graphically display them in a suitable way in the Power BI report.

So your task is to visualize your chosen dataset according to the criteria below.

Criteria
The final PBI must meet the following criteria:
2-3 pages in length
Use of at least 5 different types of visuals
Filtering using slicers
Use of bookmarks/page navigation

Linking multiple data sources, either in Power Query or in Power BI
Use of a data hierarchy of at least two levels
Creating at least 1 measure (metric/measure) and 1 calculated column
Graphical editing of the visuals used and a visually friendly resulting report
